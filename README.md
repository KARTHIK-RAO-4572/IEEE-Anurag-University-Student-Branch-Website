# Background
IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It is a globally recognized professional organization for defining standards and technical advancements. Anurag University has a IEEE Student Branch (IEEE AU SB). As the `webmaster` of IEEE AU SB (2023-24), I was responsible to build and manage official website of student branch

# What did I do?
I created a web application using ```Node JS``` as backend platform. As the website is static, dynamic frontend frameworks like Angular, etcetera was not used. This web application, with the support of Node JS, renders ```EJS```(similar to HTML) pages. Currently, it serves as official website of 7 student branch chapters, 1 affinity group at Anurag University

# Deployment
The web application was deployed on "Cyclic" platform. Cyclic is a free platform to deploy Node JS based applications. After the deployment, this web application received more than **5000** visits in just three days

# How to access the project
There are two ways to access the project\
**1. Visiting URL of the project -** As web application is deployed, it is accessible at "[ieeesbau.cyclic.app](https://ieeesbau.cyclic.app)"\

*Note:* As the app is deployed under free tier, there are chances that app may not be accessible sometimes

**2. Clone repository -** to clone the repository, execute the following command in your local system
```
git clone https://github.com/KARTHIK-RAO-4572/IEEE-Anurag-University-Student-Branch-Website.git
```
\
**a. Install dependencies -** Navigate to the cloned folder and install dependencies required by executing the following command
```
npm install
```
\
**b. Run the project -** Now, execute the following command and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
```
npm start
```
